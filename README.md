#DBDeps

An office database can grow quite complex as more features are added. Then it 
is nice to see how different database objects refer to one another. 

This tool creates a [https://www.graphviz.org/][graphviz] source file from 
the open database, when you press ALT-SHIFT-F10. Or see the tools menu, for the
menuitem "Draw dependency graph".
